# An example of BFS
This question is about how to get certain amount of water by pouring water into and out of three bottles, which hold some water initially.

We need to apply the algorithm of BFS

Basically, we need a list to store every situation, what we need to do is to go through all these situations and add all new possible situations to the list.

Typically, when we go through one situation, we will obtain more than one situations and the list will be longer.

When we meet the needed situation in the list, game is over.
